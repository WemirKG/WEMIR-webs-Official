              <h2>Who we are</h2>
              <p>
                WEMIR webs is a small, AI-focused web studio that designs and
                builds websites and related digital experiences. When this
                policy says “we,” “us,” or “our,” it’s talking about the WEMIR
                webs team.

              <h2>What this policy covers</h2>
              <p>This policy applies to information we collect:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>On this website (including all WEMIR webs pages)</li>
                <li>
                  Through forms you submit, like the contact form or intake form
                </li>
                <li>Through email or messages you send us directly</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                It does not cover information collected on other websites we
                link to, or information you share with third-party tools we
                don’t control.

            <!-- Information we collect -->
            <article class="privacy-card">
              <h2>Information we collect</h2>
              <p>We collect two main types of information:</p>

              <h3>1. Information you choose to share</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Name, email, and contact details</li>
                <li>Business or brand name</li>

                  in forms or messages

              </ul>

              <h3>2. Technical & usage information</h3>
              <p>
                Like most websites, some technical data may be collected
                automatically when you visit, such as:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Basic device and browser information</li>
                <li>Approximate location based on IP (at a general level)</li>
                <li>Pages visited and actions taken on the site</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                This type of information is generally used in an aggregated,
                non-personal way to understand how people are using the site.
